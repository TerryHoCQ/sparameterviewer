==================

A cross-platform S-parameter Viewer written in Python.

Main Features
-------------

- Visualize touchstone and Citi files, including those inside of .zip-files.
- Various flexible ways of displaying S-parameters, e.g. IL (all/reciprocal) only / RL only, linear/dB/Smith-chart/re-im, impulse/step response, Phase (normal/unwrapped), Group Delay.
- Plotting of Python-based expressions, including functions for stability factors and stability circles, for adding passive elements, checking for passivity/reciprocity/losslessness.
    - to learn more about this feature [see here](./doc/expressions.md).
- Viewing data in various table formats (e.g. dB, linear, real/imaginary, phase).
- Export data to .csv or .xlsx, copy data as Python code, save plots as images.

Roadmap

### Missing Features

- GUI: statistics on networks (e.g. mean of S-matrices), and templates for statistics.
- GUI: tell the user which file is used as "save for template".
- GUI: find a way to present the large matrix in a bigger form, e.g. as a dialog.
- GUI: find a way to assing color groups to files.
- GUI: pre-defined fixed size for saved/copied plots.
- GUI: for the documentations, find a nicer representation than plain markdown files.
- General: "TODO"-comments in code.
- GUI: expression file quick-save/quick-load and file history.
- File handling: show correct parameter names of mixed-mode parameters in `Networks.s()`, and in the GUI.
- Expressions: `f_arg` parameter for `SParams.map()`.
- Expressions: add more metadata to each SParams object, so I can track the origin (file, parameter, equstion) separately; then I could add a function to e.g. define the color by origin file.
- Expressions: could there be a more intuitive way for interaction between SParams an Numpy than `map()`?
- Expressions: introduce a `map()` function that takes an arbitrary number of SParams objects, and puts them into a Numpy method.
- Expressions: function to set plot type (i.e. when I run that equation, it automatically sets up the plot type).
- Expressions: log output for equations (so that you can also print some data or status).
- File type registration script for Windows (using `assoc` and `ftype`).


### Known Issues

- Under Fedora Linux, Gnome freezes when you open a non-Touchstone file, then open the same file again with a proper viewer; reason unknown.
